                <h3>Drive Train</h3>
                <p>
                    This robot was utilized swerve drive motors to get around quickly and efficiently. Each corner module had an encoder for the 
                    axis that turned the wheel to measure the angle at which the wheel was facing as well as an encoder for the wheel itself to measure distance.
                    This information was used along with a NavX sensor that measured the rotation of the robot to calibrate a field relative control 
                    system for the driver. This info was also used to create a coordinate grid system formatted in meters to create waypoints for the robot to go to
                    during the autonomous portion of the competition. PID was incorperated into the autonomous mode to create smooth robot movement and reduce strain on the motors.

                </p>
                <h3>Arm and Launcher Mechanism</h3>
                <p>
                    The arm was controlled by a sprocket with an encoder on the axle. Waypoints were set in radians to different buttons and 
                    a PID controller was used to get the arm from its current position to its destination in radians. The shooting code was 
                    simply turning the fly wheel motors on for a short amount of time.

                <h3>Drive Train</h3>
                <p>
                    This robot utilized a simple 6 wheel tank drive drive train system with one traction wheel in between two omniwheels on each side of the robot.
                    This competition also involved balancing on a tilting platform at the end of a round. To do this, I programmed a PID controler that used inputs from the
                    NAVX gyroscope and outputed the necessary wheel commands to balance the robot on the tilting platform.
                </p>
                <h3>Fork Lift Herder</h3>
                <p>
                    This robot utilized  a fork lift mechanism to lift field items off the ground and place them in scoring positions. The lift used a belt system
                    with an encoder to set limits on the lift as to not overextend.
