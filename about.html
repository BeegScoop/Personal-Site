            <h3>
                I grew up in Chandler, AZ where I loved the great local food, beautiful hikes, and unique scenery. Besides competeting in golf and tennis, during my high school
                years I was in the Robotics Club, was an Ambassador for my school, and was a Boy Scout. In Robotics Club, which competed in the First Robotics Competition, I gained
                experience programming as the Head Programmer and integrating designs as the Team Captain. Through my hard work in effort in Boy Scouts I also completed my Eagle Scout rank. 
                I'm now attending college at the University of Notre Dame where I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering and minor in Engineering Corporate Practice. I am always excited
                to learn new things and will do everything I can to not let opportunity slip through my fingers.
